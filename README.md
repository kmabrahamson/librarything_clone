# Rails 5/React LibraryThing Clone

A simple Rails 5/react-rails app that consumes the basic LibraryThing API, set to an internal endpoint, and sends back a random selection of 20 books per page refresh from my user account. 

Things I got to experiment with while building this:
* ES6
* fetch API
* iterating over deeply nested objects in the returned JSON

Potential future features:
* prettying it up some
* adding search functionality, using LibraryThing's other API's
